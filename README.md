# Weather App Coding Exercise

You are tasked with creating a weather forecasting application that allows users to view current and forecast weather data. The application should use React, Typescript, and OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data and provide an intuitive user interface. Some work has been done for you to setup the repository.

## Brief User Requirements

- By searching their ZIP code, a user can view weather data for any location, like the location's name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy).

- See a daily weather forecast for the next 5 days displayed in a table with borders and the weather data categories as the header.

- See an hourly weather forecast for the next 24 hours displayed in a table with borders and the weather data categories as the header.

- Be able to switch between units of measurement for temprature (Celsius, Fahrenheit) for display.

## Additional Information

- You can use any additional libraries, tools, or frameworks that you think are necessary or beneficial for the development of the application.
- We use the free version of OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data, which has some limitations on the number of API calls and the granularity of data. Please check the internal `README` for more info.
